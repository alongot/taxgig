       - Stride (stridehealth.com/tax)
       - Hurdlr (hurdlr.com)

       - Key features
       - Target audience
       - User complaints/pain points (check reviews, Reddit, app stores)
       - What they do well
       - What they do poorly

       2. Market Gaps / "Last Mile" Problems

       Identify problems that existing solutions DON'T solve well:
       - What do users complain about most?
       - What features are requested but not built?
       - Where do users still feel confused or anxious?

       3. Differentiation Opportunities

       Based on gaps found:
       - What could TaxGig do BETTER than everyone else?
       - Is there an underserved segment? (specific gig type, income level, etc.)
       - What's the "job to be done" that's not fully satisfied?

       4. Pricing Strategy Insights

       - What's the market willing to pay?
       - Is there room for a freemium model?
       - What features are "must have free" vs "worth paying for"?

       5. Competitive Threats

       - Are any big players likely to enter this space?
       - What would make existing competitors hard to beat?
